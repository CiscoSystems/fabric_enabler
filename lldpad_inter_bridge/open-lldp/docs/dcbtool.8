.SH NAME
dcbtool \- manage the Data Center Bridging (DCB) settings of a CEE DCB interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dcbtool -h
.br
.B dcbtool -v
.br
.B dcbtool [-rR]
.br
.BI "dcbtool [-rR] [" "command" "] [" "command arguments" "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dcbtool
is used to query and set the DCB settings of a
Converged Enhanced Ethernet (CEE) DCB capable Ethernet interface.  It connects to the client interface
of
.B lldpad
to perform these operations.
.B dcbtool
will operate in interactive mode if it is executed without a
\fIcommand\fR.
In interactive mode,
.B dcbtool
also functions as an event listener and will print out events
received from
.B lldpad
as they arrive. It will use libreadline for interactive input
when available. 802.1Qaz DCBX is not controllable from
.B dcbtool
instead
.B lldptool
can be used in this case. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
show the
.B dcbtool
usage message
.TP
.B \-v
shows
.B dcbtool
version information
.TP
.B \-r
display the raw
.B lldpad
client interface messages as well as the readable output.
.TP
.B \-R
display only the raw
.B lldpad
client interface messages
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B help
shows the dcbtool usage message
.TP
.B ping
test command.
.B lldpad
responds with "PPONG" if the client interface is operational.
.TP
.B license
displays
.B dcbtool
license information
.TP
.B quit
exit from interactive mode

.PP
The following commands interact with
.B lldpad
to manage the daemon and DCB features on DCB capable interfaces.

.B dcbtool
general configuration commands:
.TP
.RB "<" "gc" "|" "go" ">" " dcbx"
Get the configured or operational legacy version of the DCBX
protocol which will be supported by
.B lldpad.
The configured version, if different from the operational version,  will take effect after
.B lldpad
is restarted.
.TP
.BR "sc dcbx v:" "[" "cin" "|" "cee" "|" "force-cin" "|" "force-cee" "]"
Set the legacy version of DCBX which will be supported by
.B lldpad
the next time it is started.
.br
Information about the CIN version can be found at:
.br
<http://download.intel.com/technology/eedc/dcb_cep_spec.pdf>
.br
Information about the CEE version can be found at:
.br
<http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/docs2008/az-wadekar-dcbx-capability-exchange-discovery-protocol-1108-v1.01.pdf>
.br
The dcbx setting is a global setting and changes only take effect when
.B lldpad
is restarted.  The default DCBX version used is the IEEE standard version.
If a pre-IEEE DCBX version is received (per port) which matches the dcbx setting, then
.B lldpad
will fall back to the configured global dcbx setting.  If the dcbx setting
is set to either 'force-cin' or 'force-cee' then any port doing DCBX will
start out in the corresponding legacy DCBX mode.
.PP
DCB per-interface commands:
.TP
\fBgc \fR<\fIifname\fR> <\fIfeature\fR>
get configuration of \fIfeature\fR on interface \fIifname\fR.
.TP

.TP
\fBgp \fR<\fIifname\fR> <\fIfeature\fR>
get peer configuration of \fIfeature\fR on interface \fIifname\fR.
.TP
\fBsc \fR<\fIifname\fR> <\fIfeature\fR> <\fIargs\fR>
set the configuration of \fIfeature\fR on interface \fIifname\fR.

.TP
.BR "a:" "<" "0" "|" "1" ">"
controls whether the feature is advertised via DCBX to the peer
.TP
.BR "w:" "<" "0" "|" "1" ">"

configuration based on what is received from the peer

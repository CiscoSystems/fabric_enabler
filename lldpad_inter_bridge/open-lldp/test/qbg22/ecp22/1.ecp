 * ECP Protocol test data. Define a complete ECP DU in hex. One complete set
 * is needed for each transmission.
 * The first column defines the run time of the test program  in seconds
 * when the remaining data on this line will be sent. The rest of the line are
 * data fields which define the TLVs.
 * Line limit is 5KB, long lines can be split  with \\ as last character.
 *
 * The files are preprocessed with cpp before being read by the test program.
 *
 * The data fields per line are
 * 1. time
 * 2. destination MAC
 * 3. source MAC (- is replaced by the senders MAC address)
 * 4. ethertype
 * 5. ECP header and paylaod data field according to standard 802.1qbg 
 * 6. Optional. Several TLVs starting with @ which are expected results.
 *    Its an error is it is missing in the reply or TLV differs.

1.0 General
===========
This is an installation guide for enabling nexus fabric support on top of 
an OpenStack instllation.

Please refer to nexus fabric system configuration for how to bring up
the fabric using a spine and leaf topology with DCNM as the fabric manager.  
The compute node in an OpenStack setup should be connected to the nexus
fabric leaf switch. This link on the compute node/server is often
referred as uplink in this note.

This guide does not cover OpenStack installation, which is a complex task by itself.
For your info,  there are basically three ways in which an OpenStack 
installation can be done:
a) use DevStack for an installation for development and testing purposes (that's what we do too)
b) use a third-party supported OpenStack installation package
c) use the OpenStack general installation guidelines

In addition to OpenStack installation, the other required installations are OVS
and LLDPad - both of them are open sourced free software, similar to OpenStack.
Please follow their respective README notes to install the latest versions on
all servers that will be used as compute nodes. Please see more details below.

Please note that since OpenStack and its assoicated other pieces of open 
sourced software for this purpose is open sourced software, it generally 
requires you install the various software on your target servers as they
come from different sources.


2.0 Prerequisites
=================
The prerequisites for installing Nexus fabric OpenStack enabler are the following:
    - Linux installation on your target servers
    - Build and install LLDPad
    - Build and install OVS 
(they need to be compiled and installed on all target compute nodes in the OpenStack
setup as binaries could not be directly provied and used)

2.1 Linux installation on your target servers (we use Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS in our 
  development and UT environments.)

2.2 Build and install LLDPad

Please use the lldpad open source community mailing list of http://open-lldp.org/
for general questions.

Clone the repoitory using for installation:
git clone git://github.com/jrfastab/lldpad.git -b devel
 
Follow the instructions in README to build and install.

2.2.1 Prereq
Prereq packages for Ubuntu 12.04: 
       libtool libnl-dev libreadline6 libconfig8 autoconf flex

Prereq packages for Ubuntu 14.04: 
       libtool libnl-3-dev libreadline6 libconfig8-dev libreadline-dev libconfig-dev autoconf flex
 
The following are the general instructions for building and installing the lldpad package. 
Always refer the README for more comprehensive and up-to-date instructions.
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install


The first two commands will check for your environment and setup the necessary configuration. 
If any pre-req packages are not found, it will detect it right away and display a error message. 
After fixing the errors or installing the necessary packages, proceed with the make.



2.3 Build and install OVS
Download OVS according to instructions given in http://www.openvswitch.org/download/
Use the most recent release or any stable release after Apr 24, 2014.

3.0 OpenStack installation
==========================
For an OpenStack installation (see the three ways mentioned in the general section above), 
Specifically for supporting Nexus Fabric as the networking fabric for OpenStack, the [ml2] 
and [ovs] sections in 
./etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini should be configured as follows:

[ml2]
type_drivers = local
mechanism_drivers = openvswitch

[ovs]
bridge_mappings = ethd:br-ethd

([ml2_type_flat], [ml2_type_vlan], [ml2_type_gre] and 
[ml2_type_vxlan] sections should not be specified)

Additionally, the following OpenStack services should not be enabled
in an OpenStack installation:

- L3 agent
- DHCP service
- 'tunnel_types' should not be set. 
(i.e. 'tunnel_types =' which is in [agent] section)


4.0 Install fabric OpenStack enabler
=====================================
Make sure your OpenStack installation is running correctly based on required setting
discussed in the sections above.

4.1 On the control node in the OpenStack installation, get the source file:
   git clone https://github.com/CiscoSystems/fabric_enabler openstack_fabric_enabler

4.2 cd ~/openstack_fabric_enabler

4.3 modify enabler_conf.ini
The sections for modification is the following:

[dcnm]
cnm_ip = 172.20.234.180
dcnm_user = root                                                                                  
dcnm_amqp_user=admin 
dcnm_password = cisco123
gateway_mac = 20:20:00:00:00:AA
segmentation_id_min = 10000
segmentation_id_max = 10100    

Please make sure gateway_mac matches your PoAP template setting in DCNM for your leaf
switch. 
Please also make sure you use the right range of segment IDs administratrated by
your fabric manager.


[dfa_mysql]
# MYSQL DB connection parameter
connection = 'mysql://<username>:<password>@localhost/cisco_dfa?charset=utf8'
We used username=root and password=cisco123, this is the application level 
user name and password.
 
 
[dfa_rpc]
# Transport URL parameter for RPC
transport_url = 'rabbit://guest:guest@%(ip)s:5672//'
We used username=guest and password=guest
This is the application level user name and password.

[general]
compute_user = localadmin
compute_passwd = cisco123


The following options should be set in the keystone_authtoken section in
a)  neutron.conf:
[keystone_authtoken]
...
auth_uri = http://<ip address of controller>:5000/v2.0
identity_uri = http://<ip address of controller>:35357
auth_host = <ip address of controller>
admin_tenant_name = service
admin_user = neutron
admin_password = <admin password>
...

b) nova.conf:
[keystone_authtoken]
...
admin_password = <admin password>
admin_user = nova
admin_tenant_name = service
auth_uri = http://<ip address of controller>:5000/v2.0
identity_uri = http://<ip address of controller>:35357
auth_host = <ip address of controller>
...


It requires all control/compute nodes have same username/password - 
This is user's Linux account on the servers to run as control/compute nodes.                        

4.5 python setup_enabler

5.0 Post installation
=====================

5.1 Quick verification

- Check enabler server, agent and lldpad are running
sudo status fabric_enabler_server (on node acting as control node only)
sudo status fabric_enabler_agent  (on node acting as compute)
sudo status lldpad (on node acting as compute node)
 
- Check for existence of notification queues:
$sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues | grep cisco
cisco_dfa_keystone_notify.info  0
cisco_dfa_neutron_notify.info   0
 
- Check logs (the log file name and path is defined int he fabric_conf.ini) for any error.
 


5.2 Use OpenStack with Nexus powered fabric
There is nothing special. Just use the normal procedure with OpenStack via Horizon or
Python OpenStack script:

- Login OpenStack as admin
- Create project/tenant  (DCNM orgname should be automatically created too)
- Create user name and password
- log out
- Login in as the user using the password created in step 3 above
- Create network (network should be created in DCNM)
- Create security rule to allow DHCP (ex. allow all UDP ports) and ping for
 verificaiton
- Create instance/VM using the network and security rule created above
